# Data warehouse requirements task

Welcome to a test exercise for system analytics. You will be given a short, three paragraph long, description of a software product called "Data warehouse". Based on the description you are expected to create two outputs: three user stories, small data architecture containing at-least three items. The description may not contain complete information for each identifiable user story or data structure. If such an occasion arises you should highlight any of such pieces of missing information and point out questions by which these gaps can be filled.

Estimated time to complete this task is ca 1-2 hours. That should also serve as a hint of expected level of detail in the submission. Good luck!

### Expected outputs

- Three user stories following the classical format of "*As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].*". Keep the scope of the stories smaller than 2 person-weeks (so they would fit into a single sprint of one developer).

- (Partial) data architecture of the data warehouse. Format should be kept similar to the UML Class Diagram. Please highlight relationships between data structures if any exists.  

### Submission

1. Fork this repository

2. Format your main document as a `markdown` file (architecture can be embedded as a picture) and add it the repository.

3. Send a link to your public repository via e-mail.

### Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated in the following categories:

- Quality of the user stories

- Quality of the data architecture

- Capability to generate questions for missing information

- Capability to use technologies such as `git` and `markdown` for submission
